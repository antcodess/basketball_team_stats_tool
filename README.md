Basketball Team Stats Tool
======

With the **Basketball Team Stats Tool** I was tasked to create a console tool that will store and organize a team of basketball players into 3 distributed teams. It was specifically outlined to read data from a file named constants.py only. The data was to be clean and turned into a new collection. Each team has 6 players. 3 experienced and 3 inexperienced. Also, the players guardians and average height is calculated on each teams stats screen.
